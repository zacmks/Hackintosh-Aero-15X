## How to use this repository:

### OpenCore

`/EFI/` has a general config for OpenCore. Consider the current supported macOS version of this repository
- EFI/OC: All necessary OpenCore files (with kexts, configs, patches, etc.)
- EFI/Boot: Has other necessary boot files

**Clover is not supported anymore. Last Clover release: [2.2.0-Clover_Latest](https://github.com/zacmks/Hackintosh-Aero-15X/releases/tag/2.2.0-Clover_Latest)

*\* For Sleep: Add **-wegnoegpu** to your boot-args.* **This disables USB-C external monitor**

*\*\* Prefer to use **SSDT-Disable-DGPU.aml** patch to save power as it ACPI disables the eGPU.* **This also disables USB-C external monitor** (**-wegnoegpu** can be used in conjunction with **SSDT-Disable-DGPU.aml**)
